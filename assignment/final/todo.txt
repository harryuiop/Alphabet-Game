Things to implement:
1.  life system
2.  winner/loser message
3.  force a loss at Z
4.  game reset back to start and check for any lives left
5.  Starting board (if you lose the previous round do you start next ?)
6.  player who is starting can increment up to 4 on first turn instead of 3


Things to fix:
1.  turn off led when not your turn
2.  being able to flick through when screen is off
