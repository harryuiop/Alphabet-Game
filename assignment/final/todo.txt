Things to implement:
1.  life system
2.  winner/loser message (HALF DONE) ( we need to send a winner message to the other board)
4.  game reset back to start (DONE) and check for any lives left


Things to fix:
1.  player who is starting can increment up to 4 on first turn instead of 3
2.  Letter c coming up when game has been restarted
