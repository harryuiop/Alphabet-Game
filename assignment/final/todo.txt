Things to implement:
1.  life system
2.  winner/loser message (HALF DONE)
4.  game reset back to start (DONE) and check for any lives left
5.  Starting board (if you lose the previous round do you start next ?)(this is done because whoever gets Z, must click through and starts at A)



Things to fix:
1.  player who is starting can increment up to 4 on first turn instead of 3
